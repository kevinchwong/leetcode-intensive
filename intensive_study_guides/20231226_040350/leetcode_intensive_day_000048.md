### >> 526 Beautiful Arrangement [Medium]
Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= n) in this array: The number at the ith position is divisible by i. i is divisible by the number at the ith position. Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.
##### Sample input:
2
##### Sample output:
2

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:

- What is the range of the integers?
- Can the integers be repeated?
- Can the integers be negative?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def countArrangement(n):
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == n + 1:
            nonlocal count
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i] and (i % index == 0 or index % i == 0):
                visited[i] = True
                backtrack(index + 1)
                visited[i] = False
    count = 0
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    backtrack(1)
    return count
```
##### Time complexity:

What should be the output if the input is an empty string? Can the input contain other characters apart from digits?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []
        phone = {
            '2': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
            '3': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
            '4': ['g', 'h', 'i'],
            '5': ['j', 'k', 'l'],
            '6': ['m', 'n', 'o'],
            '7': ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
            '8': ['t', 'u', 'v'],
            '9': ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        }
        output = ['']
        for digit in digits:
            temp = []
            for letter in phone[digit]:
                for combination in output:
                    temp.append(combination + letter)
            output = temp
        return output
```
##### Time complexity:
O(3^N * 4^M)
##### Space complexity:
O(3^N * 4^M)
##### Notes:
1. Use a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters.
2. Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations.
3. Initialize the output with an empty string.
4. Iterate through each digit in the input string.
5. For each digit, iterate through each letter in its corresponding letters.
6. For each letter, iterate through each combination in the output and append the letter to the combination.
7. Update the output with the new combinations.
8. Return the final output.
1. Use a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters.
2. Use a list to store the output combinations.
3. Use nested loops to iterate through each digit and letter.
4. Append the letter to each combination in the output.
5. Update the output with the new combinations at each step.
The output is a list of strings, so the initial output should be [''] instead of ''.
Avoid using recursion as it can lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
