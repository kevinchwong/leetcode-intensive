### >> Reminder: 496 Next Greater Element I [Easy]
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2):
    stack = []
    next_greater = {}
    for num in nums2:
        while stack and stack[-1] < num:
            next_greater[stack.pop()] = num
        stack.append(num)
    return [next_greater.get(num, -1) for num in nums1]
```
Use stack to track next greater elements.
    
### >> 503 Next Greater Element II [Medium]
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
##### Sample input:
[1,2,1]
##### Sample output:
[2,-1,2]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
What should be the output if the input array is empty?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def nextGreaterElements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    stack = []
    res = [-1] * n
    for i in range(2 * n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i % n]:
            res[stack.pop()] = nums[i % n]
        stack.append(i % n)
    return res
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(n)
##### Notes:
1. Use a stack to store the indices of the elements in the array.
2. Iterate through the array twice to handle the circular nature.
3. For each element, pop elements from the stack until a greater element is found.
4. Store the next greater element in the result array.
5. If no greater element is found, store -1.
6. Return the result array.
1. Understand the problem statement and the requirements.
2. Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the elements.
3. Iterate through the array twice to handle the circular nature.
4. Use modulo operator to handle the circular indexing.
5. Pop elements from the stack until a greater element is found.
6. Store the next greater element in the result array.
7. If no greater element is found, store -1.
8. Return the result array.
Handling the circular nature of the array.
Using nested loops to find the next greater element.
    
### >> Comparison: 496 Next Greater Element I [Easy] *VS* 503 Next Greater Element II [Medium]
> Similarity distance: 0.5214
##### Similarities

- Both questions are about finding the next greater element in an array.
- Both questions have a similar input format: an array of integers.
##### Differences

- Question 496 is classified as Easy, while question 503 is classified as Medium.
- In question 496, the next greater element is to be found in the same array, while in question 503, the array is circular and the next greater element can be found in a circular manner.
- Question 496 has a constraint that the input array will have distinct elements, while question 503 does not have this constraint.
##### New Insights in 503 Next Greater Element II [Medium]

- Question 503 introduces the concept of circular arrays and finding the next greater element in a circular manner.
- Both questions provide an opportunity to practice array manipulation and understanding of stack data structure.

The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number.

    for i in range(2 * n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i % n]:
            res[stack.pop()] = nums[i % n]
        stack.append(i % n)
    return res
```
The essence of this problem is to find the next greater element for each element in a circular array.
    
### >> 239 Sliding Window Maximum [Hard]
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.
##### Sample input:
[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
3
##### Sample output:
[3,3,5,5,6,7]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
What is the range of the input array? Can the array contain negative numbers? What should be returned if the array is empty?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        if not nums:
            return []
        if k == 0:
            return nums
        res = []
        window = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if i >= k and window[0] <= i - k:
                window.pop(0)
            while window and nums[window[-1]] <= num:
                window.pop()
            window.append(i)
            if i >= k - 1:
                res.append(nums[window[0]])
        return res
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(k)
##### Notes:
1. Use a sliding window to keep track of the maximum element
2. Use a deque to store the indices of the elements in the window
3. Remove indices that are out of the window
4. Remove indices of elements that are smaller than the current element
5. Append the index of the current element to the deque
6. Append the maximum element in the window to the result
1. Use a deque to efficiently remove indices that are out of the window and indices of elements that are smaller than the current element
2. Use the sliding window technique to solve problems where we need to perform a certain operation on a fixed-size window as it moves through the array
1. Using a deque to store the indices instead of the elements
2. Removing indices that are out of the window
3. Removing indices of elements that are smaller than the current element
1. Using a sorted data structure to keep track of the maximum element
2. Using a nested loop to find the maximum element in each window
