        if num - 1 not in numSet:
            currentNum = num
            currentStreak = 1
            while currentNum + 1 in numSet:
                currentNum += 1

##### Time complexity:
O(N)
##### Space complexity:
O(N)
##### Notes:
1. Use a hash set to store the numbers for efficient lookup.
2. Iterate over each number in the set and check if it is the start of a sequence.
3. If a number is the start of a sequence, iterate forward to find the length of the sequence.
4. Update the longest streak if the current streak is longer.

3. If a number is the start of a sequence, iterate forward to find the length of the sequence.
4. Update the longest streak if the current streak is longer.
The trickiest part of this problem is finding the start of a sequence. This can be done by checking if the number minus one is not in the set.
Avoid using sorting or nested loops as they may increase the time complexity.

# 7. From 549 Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II [Medium] to 388 Longest Absolute File Path [Medium]
> Similarity Distance: 0.6238

### >> Reminder: 549 Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II [Medium]
Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0, 0
            inc, dec = 1, 1
            left_inc, left_dec = dfs(node.left)
            right_inc, right_dec = dfs(node.right)
            if node.left:
                if node.left.val == node.val + 1:
                    inc = max(inc, left_inc + 1)
                elif node.left.val == node.val - 1:
                    dec = max(dec, left_dec + 1)
            if node.right:
                if node.right.val == node.val + 1:
                    inc = max(inc, right_inc + 1)
                elif node.right.val == node.val - 1:
                    dec = max(dec, right_dec + 1)
            self.max_length = max(self.max_length, inc + dec - 1)
            return inc, dec
        self.max_length = 0
        dfs(root)
        return self.max_length
```
The essence of the problem is to find the longest consecutive path in a binary tree.
    
### >> 388 Longest Absolute File Path [Medium]
Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:
##### Sample input:
"dir
\tsubdir1
\tsubdir2
\t\tfile.ext"
##### Sample output:
20

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can the input contain multiple lines? Can the input contain empty lines? Can the input contain files and directories with the same name?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def lengthLongestPath(input):
    stack = []
    max_length = 0
    for line in input.split('
'):
        depth = line.count('\t')
        while len(stack) > depth:
            stack.pop()
        if '.' in line:
            max_length = max(max_length, len('/'.join(stack)) + len(line) - depth)
        else:
            stack.append(line)
    return max_length
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(n)
##### Notes:
Use a stack to keep track of the current path. Split the input by lines and count the depth of each line. If a line contains a file, update the maximum length if necessary. If a line contains a directory, add it to the stack.
Use the split() function to split the input by lines and the count() function to count the depth of each line.
