### >> 527 Word Abbreviation [Hard]
Given an array of n distinct non-empty strings, you need to generate minimal possible abbreviations for every word following rules below.

Begin with the first character and then the number of characters abbreviated, which followed by the last character.

If there are any conflict, that is more than one words share the same abbreviation, a longer prefix is used instead of only the first character until making the map from word to abbreviation become unique. In other words, a final abbreviation cannot map to more than one original words.

If the abbreviation doesn't make the word shorter, then keep it as original.

Example:

Input: ["like", "god", "internal", "me", "internet", "interval", "intension", "face", "intrusion"]

Output: ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]

Note:

Both n and the length of each word will not exceed 400.

The length of each word is greater than 1.

The words consist of lowercase English letters only.

The return answers should be in the same order as the original array.
##### Sample input:
["like", "god", "internal", "me", "internet", "interval", "intension", "face", "intrusion"]
##### Sample output:
["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
What is the maximum length of each word? What characters are allowed in the words? What is the maximum number of words in the array?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def wordsAbbreviation(self, dict: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def abbrev(word, i):
            if len(word) - i <= 3: return word
            return word[:i+1] + str(len(word) - i - 2) + word[-1]

        n = len(dict)
        ans = [abbrev(word, 0) for word in dict]
        for i in range(n):
            while True:
                dupes = set()
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    if ans[j] == ans[i]: dupes.add(j)
                if not dupes: break
                dupes.add(i)
                for j in dupes:
                    ans[j] = abbrev(dict[j], len(ans[j]))
        return ans
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n^2 * k), where n is the number of words and k is the maximum length of a word.
##### Space complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of words.
##### Notes:
Use a prefix abbreviation for each word. If there are conflicts, increase the prefix length until there are no conflicts.
Use a set data structure to efficiently check for conflicts.
Handling conflicts when generating abbreviations.
Using a brute force approach to generate abbreviations for each word.

### >> 288 Unique Word Abbreviation [Medium]
An abbreviation of a word follows the form <first letter><number><last letter>. Below are some examples of word abbreviations:

a) it                      --> it    (no abbreviation)

     1
     ↓

b) d|o|g                   --> d1g

              1    1  1
     1---5----0----5--8

     1---5----0
     ↓   ↓    ↓
d) l|ocalizatio|n          --> l10n

Assume you have a dictionary and given a word, find whether its abbreviation is unique in the dictionary. A word's abbreviation is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation.
##### Sample input:
["ValidWordAbbr","isUnique","isUnique","isUnique","isUnique"]

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class ValidWordAbbr:

    def __init__(self, dictionary):
        self.dictionary = dictionary
        self.abbreviations = {}
        for word in dictionary:

##### Notes:

- The abbreviation of a word is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation.
- The abbreviation is formed by concatenating the first letter, the number of letters between the first and last letter, and the last letter.
- The abbreviation is unique if it is not present in the dictionary or if it is present and maps to the same word.

# 7. From 527 Word Abbreviation [Hard] to 500 Keyboard Row [Easy]
> Similarity Distance: 0.5283

### >> Reminder: 527 Word Abbreviation [Hard]
Given an array of n distinct non-empty strings, you need to generate minimal possible abbreviations for every word following rules below.

Begin with the first character and then the number of characters abbreviated, which followed by the last character.

If there are any conflict, that is more than one words share the same abbreviation, a longer prefix is used instead of only the first character until making the map from word to abbreviation become unique. In other words, a final abbreviation cannot map to more than one original words.

If the abbreviation doesn't make the word shorter, then keep it as original.

Example:

Input: ["like", "god", "internal", "me", "internet", "interval", "intension", "face", "intrusion"]

Output: ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]

Note:

Both n and the length of each word will not exceed 400.

The length of each word is greater than 1.

The words consist of lowercase English letters only.

The return answers should be in the same order as the original array.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def wordsAbbreviation(self, dict: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def abbrev(word, i):
            if len(word) - i <= 3: return word
            return word[:i+1] + str(len(word) - i - 2) + word[-1]

        n = len(dict)
        ans = [abbrev(word, 0) for word in dict]
        for i in range(n):
            while True:
                dupes = set()
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    if ans[j] == ans[i]: dupes.add(j)
                if not dupes: break
                dupes.add(i)
                for j in dupes:
                    ans[j] = abbrev(dict[j], len(ans[j]))
        return ans
```
The essence of the problem is to generate minimal possible abbreviations for each word in the given array.

##### Sample input:

##### Sample output:
["Alaska", "Dad"]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:

- Can the words contain uppercase letters?
- Can the words contain special characters or numbers?
- Can the words be empty?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- class Solution:
-     def findWords(self, words):
-         rows = [set('qwertyuiop'), set('asdfghjkl'), set('zxcvbnm')]
-         result = []
-         for word in words:
-             for row in rows:
-                 if set(word.lower()) <= row:
-                     result.append(word)
-                     break
-         return result
```
##### Time complexity:
