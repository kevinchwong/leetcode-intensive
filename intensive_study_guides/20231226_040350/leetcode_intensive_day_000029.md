### >> 375 Guess Number Higher or Lower II [Medium]
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
##### Sample input:
4

Output: 4

Explanation: 

The numbers I pick are 1, 2, 3 and 4.

When you guess 1, I tell you that it's too low. Then you pay $1.

When you guess 2, I tell you that it's too low. Then you pay $2.

When you guess 3, I tell you that it's too low. Then you pay $3.

When you guess 4, I tell you that it's the number. You win, and you need to pay $0.

Total cost = $1 + $2 + $3 + $0 = $6.

Although the first guess is always 1, we just need to pay $6.
##### Sample output:
6

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
What is the range of n? Can n be negative?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def getMoneyAmount(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for lo in range(n, 0, -1):
            for hi in range(lo + 1, n + 1):
                dp[lo][hi] = min(x + max(dp[lo][x - 1], dp[x + 1][hi]) for x in range(lo, hi))
        return dp[1][n]
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n^3)
##### Space complexity:
O(n^2)
##### Notes:
1. Use dynamic programming to solve the problem.
2. The optimal strategy is to guess the number in the middle of the remaining range.
3. Calculate the cost of guessing each number and choose the minimum cost.
4. Use a 2D array to store the minimum cost for each range of numbers.
Try to find the optimal strategy for the problem.
The optimal strategy is to guess the number in the middle of the remaining range.

In the video game Fallout, the world is represented as a grid of rooms, where each room is either blocked (represented by 0) or empty (represented by 1). The player can move up, down, left, or right through empty rooms, but they cannot move through blocked rooms. Given a grid of rooms, a start position, and an end position, find the minimum number of steps required to reach the end position from the start position.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def findMinSteps(grid, start, end):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for k in range(m):
                    for l in range(n):
                        if grid[k][l] == 1:
                            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k][l] + abs(i - k) + abs(j - l))
    return dp[end[0]][end[1]]
```
Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of steps in a grid of rooms.
    
### >> 70 Climbing Stairs [Easy]
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
##### Sample input:
2
3
##### Sample output:
2
3

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can the number of steps be negative?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 2
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        return dp[n]
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(n)
##### Notes:
1. Use dynamic programming to solve the problem.
2. Initialize dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 2.
3. Use a loop to calculate dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] for i > 2.
4. Return dp[n] as the result.
1. Think about the base cases and the recurrence relation.
2. Use a loop to calculate the values of dp[i].
