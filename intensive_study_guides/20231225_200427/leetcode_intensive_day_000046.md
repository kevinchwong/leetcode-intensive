### >> 202 Happy Number [Easy]
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
##### Sample input:
19
##### Sample output:
true

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
1. Can the number be negative?
2. Can the number be zero?
3. Can the number be very large?
4. Can the number be a decimal?
5. Can the number be a fraction?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1:
            n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))
            if n in seen:
                return False
            seen.add(n)
        return True
```
##### Time complexity:
O(log n)
##### Space complexity:
O(log n)
##### Notes:
1. A happy number is a number that ends in 1 after repeatedly replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. If a number is not happy, it will eventually enter a cycle.
3. To detect a cycle, we can use a set to store the numbers encountered during the process.
4. If a number is encountered again, it means it is not happy and will enter a cycle.
1. Use a set to detect cycles in a process.
2. Use the sum function and a generator expression to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of a number.
3. Use the int function to convert a digit string to an integer.
4. Use the str function to convert a number to a string.
5. Use the in operator to check if a number is in a set.
1. Detecting a cycle in the process of replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. Handling very large numbers.
3. Handling numbers that do not end in 1.
1. Using a loop to iterate over the digits of the number.
2. Converting the number to a string.
3. Using recursion to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits.

### >> 481 Magical String [Medium]
A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.
