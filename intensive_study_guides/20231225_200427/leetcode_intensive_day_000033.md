Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 2:

### >> 318 Maximum Product of Word Lengths [Medium]
Given a string array `words`, find the maximum value of `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])` where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example:

```
Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```

Note:

- The length of `words` will be at most 1000.
- Each word will have length in the range [1, 1000].
- The length of each word will not exceed 15.

2. Can the words in the array be empty?
3. Can the words in the array have duplicate letters?
4. Can the words in the array have uppercase letters?
5. Can the words in the array have special characters?
6. Can there be multiple pairs of words with the maximum product?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def maxProduct(self, words):
    maxProd = 0
    bitRep = [0] * len(words)
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for c in words[i]:
            bitRep[i] |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
            if bitRep[i] & bitRep[j] == 0:
                maxProd = max(maxProd, len(words[i]) * len(words[j]))
    return maxProd
```
##### Time complexity:

##### Notes:
1. Use bit representation to represent the presence of letters in a word.
2. Compare the bit representations of two words to check if they share common letters.
3. Calculate the product of the lengths of two words if they do not share common letters.
4. Return the maximum product.
