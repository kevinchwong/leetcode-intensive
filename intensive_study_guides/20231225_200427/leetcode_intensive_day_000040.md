- Can the start and destination be outside the maze?
- Is there always a path from start to destination?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- 
- def shortestDistance(maze: List[List[int]], start: List[int], destination: List[int]) -> int:
-     m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
-     directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
-     queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])
-     distance = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
-     distance[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
-     while queue:
-         x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
-         if [x, y] == destination:
-             return dist
-         for dx, dy in directions:

### >> 499 The Maze III [Hard]
There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.
##### Sample input:

- maze = [
  [0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,0],
  [1,1,0,1,1],
  [0,0,0,0,0]
]
- start = [0,4]
- destination = [4,4]
##### Sample output:
12

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:

- What is the maximum size of the maze?
- Can the ball move diagonally?
- Can the ball move through walls?
- Can the ball move outside the maze?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- from heapq import heappop, heappush
- class Solution:
-     def findShortestWay(self, maze, ball, hole):
-         m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
-         distance = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
-         distance[ball[0]][ball[1]] = 0
-         heap = [(0, '', ball)]
-         directions = [(0, 1, 'r'), (0, -1, 'l'), (1, 0, 'd'), (-1, 0, 'u')]
-         while heap:
-             dist, path, curr = heappop(heap)
-             if curr == hole:
-                 return path
-             for dx, dy, direction in directions:
-                 x, y, d = curr[0], curr[1], 0
-                 while 0 <= x + dx < m and 0 <= y + dy < n and maze[x + dx][y + dy] == 0:
-                     x += dx
-                     y += dy
-                     d += 1
-                     if [x, y] == hole:
-                         break
-                 if distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + d < distance[x][y]:
-                     distance[x][y] = distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + d
-                     heappush(heap, (distance[x][y], path + direction, [x, y]))
-         return -1
```
##### Time complexity:
O(m * n * log(m * n))
##### Space complexity:
O(m * n)
##### Notes:

- Use a heap to prioritize the paths
- Use a 2D array to store the distances
- Use a directions array to iterate through possible directions

- Use a heap to prioritize the paths
- Use a 2D array to store the distances

### >> Reminder: 499 The Maze III [Hard]
There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.

# 5. From 499 The Maze III [Hard] to 488 Zuma Game [Hard]
> Similarity Distance: 0.5492

### >> Reminder: 499 The Maze III [Hard]
There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- from heapq import heappop, heappush
- class Solution:
-     def findShortestWay(self, maze, ball, hole):
-         m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
-         distance = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
-         distance[ball[0]][ball[1]] = 0
-         heap = [(0, '', ball)]
-         directions = [(0, 1, 'r'), (0, -1, 'l'), (1, 0, 'd'), (-1, 0, 'u')]
-         while heap:
-             dist, path, curr = heappop(heap)
-             if curr == hole:
-                 return path
-             for dx, dy, direction in directions:
-                 x, y, d = curr[0], curr[1], 0
-                 while 0 <= x + dx < m and 0 <= y + dy < n and maze[x + dx][y + dy] == 0:
-                     x += dx
-                     y += dy
-                     d += 1
-                     if [x, y] == hole:
-                         break
-                 if distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + d < distance[x][y]:
-                     distance[x][y] = distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + d
-                     heappush(heap, (distance[x][y], path + direction, [x, y]))
-         return -1
```

### >> 488 Zuma Game [Hard]
You have a row of balls on the table, colored red (R), yellow (Y), blue (B), green (G), and white (W). You also have several balls in your hand. Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row (including the leftmost position and the rightmost position). Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing this until no more balls can be removed. Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table.
##### Sample input:
"WRRBBW", "RB"
##### Sample output:
2

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can we assume the input strings will always be valid?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def findMinStep(board, hand):
    def removeBalls(board):
        i = 0
        while i < len(board):
            j = i
            while j < len(board) and board[j] == board[i]:
                j += 1
            if j - i >= 3:
                return removeBalls(board[:i] + board[j:])
            i = j
        return board
    def dfs(board, hand):
        if not board:
            return 0
        min_steps = float('inf')
        i = 0
        while i < len(board):
            j = i
            while j < len(board) and board[j] == board[i]:
                j += 1
            color = board[i]
            count = 3 - (j - i)
            if count <= len(hand.get(color, [])):
                new_board = removeBalls(board[:i] + board[j:])
                new_hand = hand.copy()
                for k in range(count):
                    new_hand[color].pop()
                min_steps = min(min_steps, count + dfs(new_board, new_hand))
            i = j
        return min_steps
    hand = collections.Counter(hand)
    return dfs(board, hand) if dfs(board, hand) != float('inf') else -1
```

3. Use a depth-first search to try all possible moves.
4. Keep track of the minimum number of steps needed to remove all balls.
