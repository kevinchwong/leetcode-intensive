Each version is developed based on the previous version. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

##### Notes:
1. Traverse the linked list to find the rightmost non-nine digit.
2. Increment the non-nine digit by one.
3. Set all the digits to the right of the non-nine digit to zero.
Use two pointers to keep track of the rightmost non-nine digit and the digits to be set to zero.
Handling the carry when the rightmost digit is nine.

### >> Comparison: 66 Plus One [Easy] *VS* 369 Plus One Linked List [Medium]
> Similarity distance: 0.5834
##### Similarities

- Both questions involve adding one to a number represented in different formats.
##### Differences

- 66 Plus One is a simple array manipulation problem, while 369 Plus One Linked List is a linked list manipulation problem.
- In 66 Plus One, the number is represented as an array of digits, while in 369 Plus One Linked List, the number is represented as a linked list of digits.
- In 66 Plus One, the array is modified in-place to represent the incremented number, while in 369 Plus One Linked List, a new linked list is created to represent the incremented number.
- In 66 Plus One, the array is read from right to left to perform the addition, while in 369 Plus One Linked List, the linked list is traversed from left to right to perform the addition.
##### New Insights in 369 Plus One Linked List [Medium]

- In both questions, we need to consider the carry when adding one to the digits.
- In 66 Plus One, we need to handle the case where the carry propagates to the most significant digit.
- In 369 Plus One Linked List, we need to handle the case where the carry propagates to the next node in the linked list.

> Similarity Distance: 0.6245

### >> Reminder: 66 Plus One [Easy]
Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        carry = 1
        for i in range(len(digits)-1, -1, -1):
            digits[i] += carry
            carry = digits[i] // 10
            digits[i] %= 10
        if carry:
            digits.insert(0, carry)
        return digits
```
The essence of this problem is to increment a non-negative integer represented by an array of decimal digits.
    
### >> 476 Number Complement [Easy]
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
##### Sample input:
5
##### Sample output:
2

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
1. Can the positive integer be zero?
2. Can the positive integer be negative?
3. Can the positive integer be floating point number?
4. What is the maximum value of the positive integer?
5. Can the positive integer be larger than the maximum value of the positive integer?
6. Can the positive integer be smaller than the minimum value of the positive integer?
7. Can the positive integer be represented in a different number system?
8. Can the positive integer be represented in a different base?
9. Can the positive integer be represented in a different radix?
10. Can the positive integer be represented in a different numeral system?
11. Can the positive integer be represented in a different positional numeral system?
12. Can the positive integer be represented in a different positional numeral system with a different radix?
13. Can the positive integer be represented in a different positional numeral system with a different base?
14. Can the positive integer be represented in a different positional numeral system with a different radix and a different base?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        mask = 1
        while mask < num:
            mask = (mask << 1) + 1
        return num ^ mask
```
##### Time complexity:
O(logn)
##### Space complexity:
O(1)
##### Notes:
1. Initialize a mask with the value 1.
2. While the mask is less than the given number, shift the mask to the left and add 1.
3. XOR the given number with the mask to get the complement number.
1. Use the bitwise shift operator (<<) in Python to shift the mask to the left.
2. Use the bitwise OR operator (+) in Python to add 1 to the mask.
3. Use the bitwise XOR operator (^) in Python to calculate the complement of the number.
1. Using bit manipulation to flip the bits of a number.
2. Using the XOR operator to calculate the complement of a number.
1. Converting the number to its binary representation and then flipping the bits.
2. Using a loop to iterate through each bit of the number and flipping it.
