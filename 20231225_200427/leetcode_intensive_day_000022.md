# 7. From 339 Nested List Weight Sum [Medium] to 364 Nested List Weight Sum II [Medium]
> Similarity Distance: 0.4382

### >> Reminder: 339 Nested List Weight Sum [Medium]
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def depthSum(nestedList):
    def dfs(nestedList, depth):
        total = 0
        for item in nestedList:
            if item.isInteger():
                total += item.getInteger() * depth
            else:
                total += dfs(item.getList(), depth + 1)
        return total
    return dfs(nestedList, 1)
```
The essence of this problem is to calculate the weighted sum of integers in a nested list using depth-first search (DFS).
    
### >> 364 Nested List Weight Sum II [Medium]
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
##### Sample input:
[[1,1],2,[1,1]]
##### Sample output:
8

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:

- What should be returned if the nested list is empty?
- Can the nested list contain negative numbers?
- Can the nested list be nested infinitely deep?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def depthSumInverse(nestedList):
    depth = getDepth(nestedList)
    return depthSumInverseHelper(nestedList, depth)


def depthSumInverseHelper(nestedList, depth):
    total = 0
    for item in nestedList:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            total += item * depth
        else:
            total += depthSumInverseHelper(item, depth - 1)
    return total


def getDepth(nestedList):
    maxDepth = 1
    for item in nestedList:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            maxDepth = max(maxDepth, getDepth(item) + 1)
    return maxDepth
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(d)
##### Notes:

- Use recursion to calculate the sum of integers weighted by their depth.
- Use a helper function to calculate the depth of the nested list.
- Handle both integers and nested lists in the recursion.

> Similarity distance: 0.4382
##### Similarities

- Both questions are about calculating the weighted sum of nested lists.
- Both questions have a similar input structure, where each element can be either an integer or a nested list.
- Both questions require traversing the nested lists to calculate the weighted sum.
##### Differences

- Question 339 calculates the weighted sum by multiplying the depth of the nested list by the integer value.
- Question 364 calculates the weighted sum by multiplying the depth of the nested list by the integer value and summing them up at each level.
- Question 364 also assigns a weight of 1 to the integers at the deepest level.
##### New Insights in 364 Nested List Weight Sum II [Medium]

- Question 364 introduces the concept of assigning different weights to integers at different levels of nesting.
- Question 364 requires a different approach to calculate the weighted sum compared to Question 339.

# 8. From 303 Range Sum Query - Immutable [Easy] to 238 Product of Array Except Self [Medium]
> Similarity Distance: 0.5088

### >> Reminder: 303 Range Sum Query - Immutable [Easy]
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums
        self.prefix_sum = [0]
        for num in nums:
            self.prefix_sum.append(self.prefix_sum[-1] + num)

    def sumRange(self, i: int, j: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix_sum[j + 1] - self.prefix_sum[i]
```
The essence of this problem is to efficiently calculate the sum of elements between two indices.
    
### >> 238 Product of Array Except Self [Medium]
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
##### Sample input:
[1,2,3,4]
##### Sample output:
[24,12,8,6]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can the input array contain zeros? Can the output array contain zeros?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    output = [1] * n
    left_product = 1
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        output[i] *= left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        output[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]
    return output
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n)
##### Space complexity:
O(1)
##### Notes:
The product of all elements except nums[i] can be calculated by multiplying the prefix product of all elements before nums[i] with the suffix product of all elements after nums[i].
Remember to handle the case when the input array contains zeros.
The trick is to calculate the prefix product and suffix product in two passes.
Avoid using division to solve the problem.
