#### Summary


- 548 Split Array with Equal Sum : Checking if there exist indices i, j, k such that the sum of subarrays are equal
- 410 Split Array Largest Sum : Use binary search to find the minimum largest sum. Define a helper function to count the number of subarrays with a sum less than or equal to a given value. Initialize the left and right pointers to the maximum and sum of the array, respectively. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer, calculate the mid value as the average of the left and right pointers. If the count of subarrays with a sum less than or equal to the mid value is greater than the target number of subarrays, update the left pointer to mid + 1. Otherwise, update the right pointer to mid. Return the left pointer as the minimum largest sum.
- 164 Maximum Gap : Sort the array and find the maximum difference between successive elements. Handle edge cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element.
- 523 Continuous Subarray Sum : The essence of the problem is to efficiently check if a subarray sum is a multiple of k using prefix sum and modulus.
- 486 Predict the Winner : The essence of this problem is to determine whether Player 1 can win in a game where each player picks a number from either end of the array.
- 53 Maximum Subarray : The essence of this problem is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array.
- 477 Total Hamming Distance : The essence of this problem is to use bit manipulation to calculate the Hamming distance between all pairs of integers in the array.
- 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum : The essence of this problem is to find the minimal length of a subarray with sum greater than or equal to a target value using a sliding window approach with two pointers.

### >> Reminder: 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum [Medium]
Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def minSubArrayLen(target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    left = 0
    res = float('inf')
    curr_sum = 0
    for right in range(n):
        curr_sum += nums[right]
        while curr_sum >= target:
            res = min(res, right - left + 1)
            curr_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
