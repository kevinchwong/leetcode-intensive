### >> Reminder: 79 Word Search [Medium]
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where 'adjacent' cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- class Solution:
-     def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
-         def backtrack(row, col, suffix) -> bool:
-             if len(suffix) == 0:
-                 return True
-             if row < 0 or row == len(board) or col < 0 or col == len(board[0]) or board[row][col] != suffix[0]:
-                 return False
-             ret = False
-             board[row][col] = '#'
-             for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
-                 ret = backtrack(row + dx, col + dy, suffix[1:])
-                 if ret:
-                     break
-             board[row][col] = suffix[0]
-             return ret
-         for i in range(len(board)):
-             for j in range(len(board[0])):
-                 if backtrack(i, j, word):
-                     return True
-         return False
```
