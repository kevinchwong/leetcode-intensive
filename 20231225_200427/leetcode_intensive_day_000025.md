    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == ' ':
            s[start:i] = reversed(s[start:i])
            start = i + 1
    s[start:] = reversed(s[start:])
    return s
```
##### Time complexity:

> Similarity Distance: 0.3700

### >> Reminder: 186 Reverse Words in a String II [Medium]
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word while preserving the order of the words.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
def reverseWords(s):
    s.reverse()
    start = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):

            start = i + 1
    s[start:] = reversed(s[start:])
    return s
```
The essence of this problem is reversing the words in a string while preserving the order of the words.
    
### >> 344 Reverse String [Easy]
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[]. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
##### Sample input:
["h","e","l","l","o"]
##### Sample output:
["o","l","l","e","h"]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can the input string be empty? Can the input string contain special characters or spaces?

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```
##### Time complexity:

Given a string, we can shift each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep shifting the letters to form a sequence. Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
##### Sample input:

- "abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"
##### Sample output:

- [["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"],["acef"],["a","z"]]

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:

- Can the input list be empty?
- Can the input strings contain uppercase letters or special characters?
- Should the output groups be sorted?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- from collections import defaultdict
- class Solution:
-     def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
-         groups = defaultdict(list)
-         for s in strings:
-             key = tuple((ord(c) - ord(s[0])) % 26 for c in s)
-             groups[key].append(s)
-         return list(groups.values())
```
##### Time complexity:
O(n*m)
##### Space complexity:
O(n)
##### Notes:

- Group strings that belong to the same shifting sequence
- Use a dictionary to store the groups
- Calculate a key for each string based on the difference between each character and the first character
- Return the values of the dictionary as the result

- Use defaultdict to simplify the code
- Use modulo operation to handle circular shift of characters

- Handling the circular shift of characters
- Using a dictionary to group the strings

- Sorting the input list
- Nested loops

# 7. From 555 Split Concatenated Strings [Medium] to 482 License Key Formatting [Easy]
> Similarity Distance: 0.5170

### >> Reminder: 555 Split Concatenated Strings [Medium]
Given a list of strings, you could concatenate these strings together into a loop, where for each string you could choose to reverse it or not. Among all the possible loops, you need to find the lexicographically biggest string after cutting the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one.
##### Optimal Python solution:
```python

- def splitLoopedString(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
-     def reverse(s):
-         return s[::-1]
-     def concat(s1, s2):
-         if s1 > s2:
-             return s1 + s2
-         else:
-             return s2 + s1
-     n = len(strs)
-     res = ''
-     for i in range(n):
-         rev = reverse(strs[i])
-         if rev > strs[i]:
-             strs[i] = rev
-     for i in range(n):
-         for j in range(len(strs[i])):
-             s1 = strs[i][j:]
-             s2 = strs[i][:j]
-             s = concat(s1, s2)
-             for k in range(i+1, n):
-                 s += strs[k]
-             s += concat(s2, s1)
-             res = max(res, s)
-             s = concat(s1, reverse(s2))
-             for k in range(i+1, n):
-                 s += strs[k]
-             s += concat(reverse(s2), s1)
-             res = max(res, s)
-     return res
```

### >> 482 License Key Formatting [Easy]
You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Example 1:

Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.

Example 2:

Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

Note:

The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.

String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).

String S is non-empty.
##### Sample input:
"5F3Z-2e-9-w"

4
##### Sample output:
"5F3Z-2E9W"

##### Questions to ask to clarify requirements:
Can the input string contain spaces? Can the input string contain special characters other than alphanumeric characters and dashes?

##### Optimal Python solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, S: str, K: int) -> str:
        S = S.replace('-', '').upper()
        n = len(S)
        if n == 0:
            return ''
        first_group_length = n % K
        if first_group_length == 0:
            first_group_length = K
        result = S[:first_group_length]
        for i in range(first_group_length, n, K):
            result += '-' + S[i:i+K]
        return result
```
##### Time complexity:
O(N)
##### Space complexity:
O(N)
##### Notes:
1. The license key needs to be reformatted to have each group contain exactly K characters.
2. The first group can be shorter than K, but must contain at least one character.
3. All lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.
4. Use string manipulation to remove dashes and convert to uppercase.
5. Split the string into groups of length K and insert dashes between groups.
1. Use string manipulation techniques to remove dashes and convert to uppercase.
2. Split the string into groups of length K and insert dashes between groups.
3. Handle the case when the first group is shorter than K.
The trickiest part of this problem is handling the case when the first group is shorter than K.
Avoid using regular expressions to solve this problem.
